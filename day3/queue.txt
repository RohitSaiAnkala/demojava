--FIRST IN FIRST OUT
The first element inserted is the first elemented to be deleted.

Enqueue
--Add an element to the queue(rear side).
Overflow--When you try to add an element  to a queue which is full

Dequeue
--Delete an element from the front side of the queue.
Underflow--When you try to delete an element from a queue which is empty

Enqueue Algorithm

if queue is full(rear==size)--> Queue Overflow
else:
  	add element to queue
  	q[++rear]=ele;

Dequeue Algorithm

if queue is empty(front==-1)--> Queue Underflow
else:
  	delete element from queue
  	return q[front++];
